npm install
npm run start
```

## Features

## Credits and Attributions
I modelled Chah on the Shopify Theme [Foodie by We Are Underground](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/foodie/styles/grind).

Especially for the cart component, I tried to replicate the design and the responsive behaviour pretty closely:

I also used the colours, fonts, buttons, and a few other inspirations throughout the site. It was a pleasure to work off of a professional design instead of trying to create my own, and it saved me quite a bit of time relative to my previous frontend projects :)
