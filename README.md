# Lipton Tea Website Clone ☕


### 📝 **Project Overview**  
This project is a clone of the Lipton Tea website, featuring an engaging parallax frontend built using React. The cart functionality was originally included, and I added the parallax frontend effect to enhance user experience. The design focuses on delivering a smooth, interactive, and responsive interface.
